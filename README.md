# Json2Pojo
IntelliJ plugin that allows for easy creation of Java POJOs from JSON, with GSON annotations and accessors.

## Usage
1. Install the plugin in IntelliJ / Android Studio by opening Preferences -> Plugins -> Search for "Json2Pojo". 
2. Right-click on the target package, select New -> "Generate POJOs from JSON".
3. Enter the root class name and enter your source JSON text. 

The plugin will generate your new classes in the target directory for easy deserialization with GSON.
